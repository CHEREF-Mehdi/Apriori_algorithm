# Apriori_algorithm

Apriori [1] is an algorithm for frequent item set mining and association rule learning over transactional databases. It proceeds by identifying the frequent individual items in the database and extending them to larger and larger item sets as long as those item sets appear sufficiently often in the database. The frequent item sets determined by Apriori can be used to determine association rules which highlight general trends in the database: this has applications in domains such as market basket analysis.

You should first specify how much trasaction and itemset you want to create in order to setup a random data matrix

# About the source code

The apriori algorithm was implemented using php, you can find it in Pages/PHP/Apriori.class.php

The interface is powered by bootstrap.
